Lady in street has lost her cat, and wants you to help find it.

She tells you that she his name is Bradley Pawers, but that he responds to the name Bradders, and that he's black with a white nose.

She says he could be anywhere, but he loves ice cream.

On finding a similar looking cat, who follows you after petting, you take it back to the lady.

She asks who you are? And why you've brought her a cat, when she's looking for a brown dog called Abernathy? Abernathy also loves ice cream, so maybe he's near some ice cream sellers.

You find a dog near a different ice cream seller, and he follows yon after petting him. You take it back to the lady.

She asks who you are, and why you've brought her a dog? You explain that this isn't the first time this has happened.

She looks confused and says "I've never had a pet". She then mutters something about ice cream, and how you're a dirty ice cream seller.

You ask "what is it with you and ice cream". She explains "I've never been a fan."

Later you see her buying an ice cream cone and ask her why she's buying an ice cream if she isn't a fan. She looks at you puzzled and says, do I know you?

Even later you see a panicked looking nurse near the hospital. He says he's looking for a patient who's a bit strange about ice cream.

You can choose to tell him where she is or not. If you choose not to, then she remains by the ice cream truck.

If you choose to, he rushes off. At the ice cream truck, you see him detaining her, she looks you in the eye and says.

"Why did you do this to me? All I wanted was your help, and instead all you gave me was judgements and suspicion."

She's led off, and you feel sad.
