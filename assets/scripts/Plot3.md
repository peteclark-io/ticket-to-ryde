# Initial Interaction

A shady individual stops you in an alleyway.

"Charlie? Yayo?" he says.

You stare at him blankly.

"Ganja? Sniffy Sniffy? Ebeneezer?"

You can only choose to say: "I don't know what you're on about"

He laughs and says "I like you man, you Pommies crack me up."

You can only ask: "What's a Pommie?"

He laughs again "See what I mean! Come on mate, come meet some friends of mine"

He leads you into a nearby shack, which somehow opens up into a cavernous regal mansion.

He laughs at your shock "Bet you didn't expect that did ya mate"

He leads you through to a evil style conference room - and round the table is Tony Abbott, Barnaby Joyce and Ricky Ponting.

They look surprised - "Who the fuck is this Hugh?"

"Ah he's harmless, I'm just showing him around" says Hugh Jackman

"Ya can't show him around here! How do we know we can trust him! We have no dirt on him!"

"We can just get him to deliver that package!" says Hugh, pointing at a mysterious brown package. "You can do that for us can't ya mate. Deliver that to the man in the green hat, he usually hangs out by the docks!"

You take the package and leave, confused by the fairly surreal experience you just had.

# Take to the Journalist

At this point, if you have already met the Journalist, you can go talk to her, reveal your story and give him the package (see journo story for more details). Alternatively, you can proceed and find the man in the green hat.

# Green Hat Man

Green hat man says "I can tell you're new, not exactly subtle you bogan. Walking straight up to me, holding a package like that. I can't accept this until you pay your respects to the bossman. Get yourself a red flower and meet me in Byron Bay."

Find him in Byron Bay, he walks you to man sunbathing by the sea.
