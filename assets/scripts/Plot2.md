# Initial Chat

You come across a journalist scribbling notes furiously outside a cafe.

She shouts at you - "hey, what's 12 * 3 mate!?"

You have three choices: 36, 37, 24

Whether you select correctly or not, she says "Are you having a laugh? Everyone knows it's 24." Begins scribbling again.

When you move away, she follows and says "Hey, you couldn't do me a favour could you mate? I'm on to something, something big. A dark streak runs through this beautiful city, a cavernous, poisonous sea of crime, drugs, sex, you name it. That sea flows just beneath the idyllic normality of the surface."

You look at her puzzled.

"Look all I'm asking mate, is that if you see or find anything that strikes you as weird, bring it to me! You're not from here, so you might see things that I can't."

You leave.
