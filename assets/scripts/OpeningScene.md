Emma: WELCOME TO SYDNEY!!
Emma: I'm so glad you finally made it!
Emma: I've got so many ideas for activities, but I'm wary that you only have 10 DAYS here, so we'll struggle to fit it all in....
Emma: You must be tired though! Let's get you checked in to a hotel!
Emma: I've marked some local hotels on the map, why don't you get some rest, and then come meet me at my place in the South West of Sydney?
